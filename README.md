# GL Scratch Pad

The GL Scratch Pad is a framework that allows OpenGL programmers to prototype and experiment more easily. It accomplishes this goal by allowing the programmer to designate data as being modifiable by a GUI controller; data modified in such a way is instantly updated and read by the program with no recompilation necessary.
